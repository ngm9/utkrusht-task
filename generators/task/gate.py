"""E2B build/test gate invocation for the create-task retry loop.

Wraps the *policy* of "when do we run the gate and what does the loop do
with the result" — separates that from the gate's own mechanics, which live
in ``infra/e2b/sandbox_eval``.

The retry loop in ``create_task`` calls :func:`run_gate_for_attempt` after
the LLM eval critics pass. The function returns one of four outcomes via
:class:`GateOutcome` so the loop never needs to inspect the raw
``SandboxEvalResult`` itself:

* ``PASS`` — gate ran and passed → proceed to storage.
* ``SKIPPED`` — gate produced no verdict (no template for the runtime, no
  code, infra flake) → proceed to storage normally; a skip never blocks.
* ``DISABLED`` — ``SANDBOX_EVAL_ENABLED`` is off → proceed to storage.
* ``RETRY`` — gate FAILED → retry the generation with the returned
  ``feedback`` string.
